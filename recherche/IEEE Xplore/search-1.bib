Different Bayesian network structures are learned and used according to different event context.

The prototype implementation of the system uses an open-source Siddhi CEP engine on the mobile device and an open-source Web Services Oxygen (WSO2) IoT Server on the IHS. In this architecture, complete complex event detection is performed on the edge and the complex event streams are sent to the hospital server using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The MQTT broker forwards complex event streams to an event listener service running on the hospital server that notifies the hospital staff. Advantages of performing CEP on the edge include circumventing out-of-order delivery of various health sensor streams, avoiding queuing delays at the hospital server and reducing the user cost for data transfer between the mobile device and the hospital server. Also, this technique provides the ability to generate local alarms for the patient even when the mobile network connecting the device to the hospital server is unavailable.",

The biggest challenge of the IoT systems is that the systems collect a massive amount of uncertain data from diverse IoT devices, where the devices are connected through the internet. In addition to that, some events are inferred from other events and uncertainty is propagated from parent events to the inferred events, which additionally contributes to overall system uncertainty. The observed complex events are a complex relationship of primitive events that are produced by IoT devices and collected in IoT system. There were a couple of attempts to quantify the system uncertainty by estimating the likelihood of the occurrence of events of interest while taking into account the uncertain data and uncertain parameters of the model of the physical system with rule-based complex event processing and/or Bayesian network. These methods were implemented as stand-alone software solutions that are unable to scale under heavy loads of incoming events.

For using this hidden potential, complex event processing (CEP) systems offer means to efficiently detect event patterns (complex events) in the sensor streams and therefore, help in realizing a “distributed intelligence” in the IoT. With the increasing number of data sources and the increasing volume at which data is produced, parallelization of event detection is crucial to limit the time events need to be buffered before they actually can be processed. In this paper, we propose a pattern-sensitive partitioning model for data streams that is capable of achieving a high degree of parallelism in detecting event patterns, which formerly could only consistently be detected in a sequential manner or at a low parallelization degree. Moreover, we propose methods to dynamically adapt the parallelization degree to limit the buffering imposed on event detection in the presence of dynamic changes to the workload. Extensive evaluations of the system behavior show that the proposed partitioning model allows for a high degree of parallelism and that the proposed adaptation methods are able to meet a buffering limit for event detection under high and dynamic workloads.",

The notion of event is an important cornerstone to manage big data. High-speed railway is one of the most typical application domains for event-based system, especially for the train onboard system. There are usually numerous complex event patterns subscribed in system sharing the same prefix, suffix, or subpattern; consequently, multipattern complex event detection often results in plenty of redundant detection operations and computations. In this paper, we propose a multipattern complex event detection model, multipattern event processing (MPEP), constructed by three parts: 1) multipattern state transition; 2) failure transition; and 3) state output. Based on MPEP, an intelligent onboard system for high-speed train is preliminarily implemented. The system logic is described using our proposed complex event description model and compiled into a multipattern event detection model. Experimental results show that MPEP can effectively optimize the complex event detection process and improve its throughput by eliminating duplicate automata states and redundant computations. This intelligent onboard system also provides better detection ability than other models when processing real-time events stored in high-speed train Juridical Recording Unit (JRU).",

In many application scenarios, a lot of complex events are long-term, which takes a long time to happen. Processing long-term complex event with traditional approaches usually leads to the increase of runtime states and therefore impact the processing performance. Hence, it requires an efficient long-term event processing approach and intermediate results storage/query policy to solve this type of problems. In this paper, we propose an event processing system, LTCEP, for long-term event. In LTCEP, we leverage the semantic constraints calculus to split a long-term event into two parts, online detection and event buffering respectively. A long-term query mechanism and event buffering structure are established to optimize the fast response ability and processing performance. Experiments prove that, for long-term event processing, LTCEP model can effectively reduce the redundant runtime state, which provides a higher response performance and system throughput comparing to other selected benchmarks.",

Even though there is a considerable effort in the literature for verification of such complex and distributed systems, a practical solution for IoT systems that supports runtime system verification is still missing. In this paper, we present a runtime monitoring approach for IoT systems that exploits event relations expressed in terms of sequential interaction messaging model of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). We propose the use of Complex-Event Processing (CEP) to detect failures at runtime by exploiting complex event patterns defined via predetermined event algebra.

    abstract  = "Artwork transportation processes are generally agreed-upon, and long running propositions between multiple partners that are specified over service level agreements, performance, and complex quality constraints to be maintained. The complexity of the constraints is defined by the sensitivity, value, and significance of artworks, where any recorded damage would probably leave undesired marks on the long-term, and diminish the lifetime of art pieces. Due to the uncontrollable, and unpredictable nature of the context during transportation, the specified constraints are often violated in real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the PACT-ART architecture to integrate advanced computing techniques with transportation activities. This integration counts on external and Internet of Things (IoT) services to draw and understand the context of activities, thus it paves a way to predict a future state of the ongoing process and point out any possible violation in advance. Moreover, PACT-ART combines Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques and makes this technology available even to non-experts in the domain. Finally, we showcase some initial experiments on real-life transportation scenarios that testify to the efficiency of our proposal.",

In this regard, we propose a proactive architecture which exploits historical data using machine learning for prediction in conjunction with CEP. We propose an adaptive prediction algorithm called adaptive moving window regression for dynamic IoT data and evaluated it using a real-world use case with an accuracy of over 96%. It can perform accurate predictions in near real-time due to reduced complexity and can work along CEP in our architecture.

Since a CEP system selects and executes a rule from rules that match identified events, i.e., multiple rules are sequentially executed. This, however, causes a problem in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment since rule execution is slow and the remaining rules must wait to be executed. Simply executing rules in parallel may trigger interference between rules, and thus unexpected and undesirable results. This paper extends the traditional CEP system by developing an execution model for parallel rule firing in the IoT environment so as to be able to execute multiple rules in parallel without any interference. We start with an extended parallel firing condition by adding the definition of dependency between sensors and actuators to the condition. Next, we extend synchronization control of parallel firing so as to avoid the interference among rules that can occur when actions take a lot of time to execute. This paper reveals that the extended CEP system (i) realizes triple parallelism (i.e., data parallelism, task parallelism, and pipeline parallelism) in the IoT environment and (ii) avoids the case where rule execution triggers unexpected results.",

Solutions based on Complex Event Processing (CEP) have the potential to extract high-level knowledge from these data streams but the use of CEP for distributed IoT applications is still in early phase and involves many drawbacks. The manual setting of rules for CEP is one of the major drawback. These rules are based on threshold values and currently there are no automatic methods to find the optimized threshold values. In real-time dynamic IoT environments, the context of the application is always changing and the performance of current CEP solutions are not reliable for such scenarios. In this regard, we propose an automatic and context aware method based on clustering for finding optimized threshold values for CEP rules.

We introduce a pseudo-source mechanism to cover a wide range of processing and obsolete prerequisite of source-specification at the same time, along with a brand-new event specification language defined to support relation-based processing. Against cloud-based approaches, our behind-edge approach can prevent data overflow and privacy issues, and fully distributed processing can draw the power of the edge devices. To achieve that in a resource-limited edge environment, we formulate an optimization problem of processing task assignment and stream delivery, and propose a fully-autonomous workload distribution mechanism. A large-scale simulation with a realistic smart-building scenario shows that our proposed method achieves about 6.6 times smaller flow volume and 2 times lower loss rate compared to centralization and is relatively superior to a hop-based distribution approach. Notably, a prototype engine is successfully deployed over an ad-hoc wireless sensor and actuator network through Intel Edison modules in the real environment.",

Almost all of these applications involve analyzing complex data streams with low latency requirements. In this regard, pattern recognition methods based on CEP have the potential to provide solutions for analyzing and correlating these complex data streams in order to detect complex events. Most of these solutions are reactive in nature as CEP acts on real-time data and does not exploit historical data. In our work, we have explored a proactive approach by exploiting historical data using machine learning methods for prediction with CEP. We propose an adaptive prediction algorithm called Adaptive Moving Window Regression (AMWR) for dynamic IoT data and evaluated it using a real-world use case.

Such an increasing need requires tools and platforms that can easily and effectively be controlled by nontechnical people. In this paper, an approach for enabling “easier” composition of real-time data processing pipelines in smart cities is presented, exploiting a visual and block-based design approach, similar to the one adopted in the Scratch programming language for elementary school students. The proposed approach encompasses both a graphical editor and a sound methodology and workflow, to allow city operators to effectively design, develop, test, and deploy their own data processing pipelines.

In this paper, we propose a scalable cognitive acoustics analytics service for IoT that provides the user an incremental learning approach to evolve their analytics capability on non-intuitive and unstructured acoustic data through the combination of acoustic signal processing and machine learning technology. It first performs acoustic signal processing and denoising, enables acoustic signal based abnormal detection based on sound intensity, spectral centroid, etc. Then based on the accumulated abnormal data, a supervised learning method is performed as baseline and a neural network based classifier is used to recognize acoustic events in different scenarios with various volume of sample data and requirement of accuracy. In addition, acoustic sensor arrays processing is supported for localization of moving acoustic source in more complex scenario. In this paper, we designed a hybrid computing structure.

First, each instance of the multivariate data is represented as a line on a set of parallel coordinates. Then a shapelet-learner algorithm is applied to those lines to extract the relevant shapelets. Afterwards, the identified shapelets are ranked based on their information gain. Next, the shapelets with similar information gain are divided into groups by a shapelet-merger algorithm.

The proposed technique can be applied to both multivariate and multivariate time-series data, and it is computationally and memory efficient. It enables users to focus only on the shapelets with relevant information gains. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed technique using a set of real-world datasets.",

The computing needs for the IoT continue to rise in terms of scalable compute power, storage, and complex data processing pipelines to accommodate these diverse sources of data. For this reason, it becomes essential to develop a flexible framework that is able to efficiently manage the IoT data in a real-time and scalable approach. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to handle IoT data. Our framework is dynamically extensible, lightweight, resources efficient, and has the ability to handle stream data as well as batch data. We leverage autonomous agents along with the publish-subscribe pattern to achieve a run-time extensible, event-driven, and high-performance computational architecture. Additionally, we have incorporated localized and centralized databases into the framework to support structured and unstructured data for compute processing and analytical tasks. We have implemented the proposed framework and evaluated its performance using a visual object-detection case study on both a local cluster and within cloud-computing infrastructure. Our analysis shows that this framework utilizes the CPU, memory, and network resources efficiently. Additionally, the framework can scale horizontally as adding more processing nodes reduces the time and increases the goodput.",

    abstract  = "The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), with modern sensors and sensor-based devices, will significantly stimulate the development of context-aware applications. An effective means to extract higher-level contextual information from sensor data is distributed complex event processing (CEP), which facilitates the analysis of real-time data streams coming from heterogeneous and distributed sources. Considering that user context is inherently sensitive information, the preservation of privacy is critical once the processing of user context takes place over several (possibly malicious) devices, especially in collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a trust-based approach for the placement and execution of CEP operators in a distributed environment. We propose a trust management model based on communication interactions among the users. Furthermore, we incorporate trust recommendations using a cosine-based similarity check in order to overcome collusion and on-off attacks. We developed a smartphone-based distributed CEP system called TrustCEP to evaluate our approach for trust management. Based on the evaluation of TrustCEP, we observe that our approach induces a minimal increase in average battery consumption compared to privacy-negligent approaches.",

Moreover, these architectures need to be capable of offering low-latency delivery, which must not only feed real-time analytics applications, but also produce real-time actionable data that could enable operational business logic and automation triggers activation and transform microservices into cyber-physical microapplications. The design principles to build distributed event-driven applications are known to be complex and hard to handle at the application code level. As a result, there are several already well-known patterns that aim to provide a convenient solution and abstract the business logic development from the underlying architecture complexities. This paper proposes a common framework that addresses all the needs of an in-production application, that are hard to solve under the event-driven paradigm. It gathers existing patterns and combines them and extends them.

However, there are other metrics, which system administrators and users should consider, such as information latency, the correctness of results, adaptability on different workloads and others. Therefore, in this paper, we summarized some key metrics used to assess systems for processing online data streams.

In addition, the event composition rules were predefined before the CEP engine began working. The rule defining task is error-prone and cumbersome. In this paper, therefore, a hybrid complex event service is proposed, which deals with not only discrete events but also continuous behavior computation based on IoT (Internet of Things) resource models. In order to satisfy the real-time constraints of processing IoT events, a divide-and-conquer principle is adopted, where we give a combination theorem such that different events can be processed on different IoT resources and then these processed results can be combined to derive complex events. Based on the formal IoT resources and event knowledge, we define interest goals to direct event composition without enumerating event relation to define event composition rules. We finally present event composition algorithms and evaluation to show our idea.",

Despite the drive toward increased dataset variety, and while Big Data has had a correspondingly large impact on containerization and DevOps, the impact on information assurance (IA) has been incremental. This chapter surveys approaches to leverage Big Data techniques to enhance IoT provenance, which is itself only one of multiple measures needed to improve information assurance. A number of thus far loosely connected approaches are identified and addressed. Systematic use of concept of complex event processing (CEP) can improve on current information assurance practices, especially if its paradigms and design practices are more widely incorporated into IoT architectures.

Continuous and discrete variables of different machines are monitored to analyze performance using a virtual environment running synchronous to plant floor equipment as a reference. Data are extracted from machines using industrial Internet of Things solutions. Productivity and reliability of a physical system are compared in real time with data from a hybrid simulation. The simulation uses discrete-event systems to estimate performance metrics at a system level, and continuous dynamics at a machine level to monitor input and output variables. Simulation outputs are used as a reference to detect abnormal conditions based on deviations of real outputs in different stages of the process. This monitoring method is implemented in a fully automated manufacturing system testbed with robots and CNC machines. Machines are integrated on an Ethernet/IP control network using a programmable logic controller to coordinate actions and transfer data. Results demonstrated the capacity to perform real-time monitoring and capture performance errors within confidence intervals. Note to Practitioners-Estimating expected performance of a manufacturing system processing different parts across multiple machines is a complex problem due to the lack of closed-form equations. Existing solutions focus on monitoring stochastic variables such as production or failure rate, or machine dynamics in separate environments often running asynchronous to the real system. This paper addresses the problem of monitoring and assessing the performance of complex manufacturing systems in real time. The proposed framework uses a real-time hybrid simulation of manufacturing at a machine and system level. The hybrid approach is based on a discrete and continuous model of manufacturing equipment integrated to run synchronously with the real plant floor operation. Data from both the virtual and real environments are merged to assess performance. Deviations from expected values represent an error that can trigger a warning signal to production, maintenance, and/or manufacturing personnel at the plant regarding health and productivity of plant operations.",

A typical IoT application aims to connect a set of nodes, capable of processing data and making decisions regarding the goal of the IoT application, with other nodes containing smart objects with robotic components to collect data from their environment. In this paper, a generic model for novel context-aware and adaptive IoT architecture is presented. A group of nodes contains a controller interface (CI) that is used to control other nodes containing a controller unit (CU) which communicates randomly. CU nodes have complex control systems comprising both actuators and sensors, however CI nodes typically do not have detailed knowledge of such individual functionalities. Instead, at run time, control program logic (CPL) is downloaded by the CI to facilitate control and communication. The system also allows for different CPLs for any particular CU. In such an open and adaptive IoT environment, an architecture is required that can provide sufficient flexibility in designing nodes while maintaining uniformity in the IoT system to allow for interoperability and reliability. Using the notion of automata, a generalized mathematical description is presented that allows modeling of the CI and CU nodes and their operation. This model can then be used to formulate and solve problems regarding the interaction between CIs and CUs. The application of this model is demonstrated through a case study involving remote access laboratories where the CI–CU model is used.",

In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time.

Topically such events require avoiding waste of resources in environments where there are no people at the time of the disaster or where the damage is of low magnitude. To guide rescuers at the points of the building where there are users to help, we modeled and built an Internet of Things-based framework that monitors data and environmental parameters of interest and, if certain thresholds are exceeded, alerts the rescuers through a telephone call to emergency numbers. The hardware infrastructure is driven by a complex, flexible and adaptive software layer that behaves depending on a Complex Event Processing engine and a reflective middleware according to the rule based engine that manages data from the sensors and reasoning mechanisms of a knowledge base that models the given domain.",

Instead, data streams must be fused into tangible facts and these pieces of information must be combined with a background knowledge to infer new pieces of knowledge. And since many IoT applications require almost realtime reactivity to stimulus of the environment, such information inference process has to be performed in a continuous, on-line manner. This paper proposes a new semantic model for data stream processing and real-time reasoning based on the concepts of Semantic Stream and Fact Stream, as a natural extension of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and RDF (graph-based knowledge model). The main advantages of our approach are that 1) it considers time as a key relation between pieces of information; 2) the processing of streams can be implemented using CEP; 3) it is general enough to be applied to any Data Stream Management System (DSMS). Lastly, we will present challenges and prospects on using machine learning and induction algorithms to learn abstractions and reasoning rules from a continuous data stream.",

Offloading data classification and anomaly event detection tasks to sink nodes in sensor networks can reduce the computing complexity, lower remote communication loads and improve the response time for the delay-sensitive IoT applications. Many existing classification and anomaly detection methods cannot be directly applied to these IoT applications, because the computing and energy resources of sensors are limited. In this paper, a new feature-based learning system for IoT applications is proposed to effectively classify data and detect anomaly event. Especially, based on the theory of distributed compression, the sparsity and relativity of the data are exploited to obtain the classification features, which can reduce the computation overhead and energy consumption. Further,a RBF-BP hybrid neural network is employed to detect the anomaly event based on the classification results, by which the training time of neural network can be significantly reduced and the accuracy can be improved for users’ decisions.",

Several research studies analyzing the economical impact of the IoT worldwide identify the interoperability as one of the main boosting factor for its growth, thanks to the possibility to unlock novel commercial opportunities derived from the integration of heterogeneous systems which are currently not interconnected. However, at present, interoperability constitutes a relevant practical issue on any IoT deployments that is composed of sensor platforms mapped on different wireless technologies, network protocols or data formats. The paper addresses such issue, and investigates how to achieve effective data interoperability and data reuse on complex IoT deployments, where multiple users/applications need to consume sensor data produced by heterogeneous sensor networks. We propose a generic three-tier IoT architecture, which decouples the sensor data producers from the sensor data consumers, thanks to the intermediation of a semantic broker which is in charge of translating the sensor data into a shared ontology, and of providing publish-subscribe facilities to the producers/consumers. Then, we describe the real-world implementation of such architecture devised at the Advanced Research Center on Electronic System (ARCES) of the University of Bologna. The actual system collects the data produced by three different sensor networks, integrates them through a SPARQL Event Processing Architecture (SEPA), and supports two frontend applications for the data access, i.e., a web dashboard and an Amazon Alexa voice service.",

In CEP, an operator network is used to search for patterns in events streams. Sometimes these operators fail and lose their state. Rollback-recovery is a method for dealing with such state losses. The type of rollback-recovery we consider is upstream backup, where the state of a failed operator is recovered by replaying to it the input events that led it to that state. These events are kept in upstream operators' memory buffers, which are trimmed continuously as the downstream operator progresses. The first extension we propose saves memory and speeds up recovery by avoiding to store and retransmit unnecessary events. The second extension makes the base method of upstream backup compatible with data-parallel CEP, allowing that the windows into which operators partition their input be processed in parallel. We evaluated the proposed extensions through experiments that showed a significant reduction in memory usage and recovery time at the expense of a negligible processing overhead during normal operation.",

Smart city applications enable city authorities to monitor, manage and provide plans for public resources and infrastructures in city environments, while offering citizens and businesses to develop and use intelligent services in cities. However, providing such smart city applications gives rise to several issues such as semantic heterogeneity and trustworthiness of data sources, and extracting up-to-date information in real time from large-scale dynamic data streams. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel framework with an efficient semantic data processing pipeline, allowing for real-time observation of the pulse of a city. The proposed framework enables efficient semantic integration of data streams and complex event processing on top of real-time data aggregation and quality analysis in a Semantic Web environment. To evaluate our system, we use real-time sensor observations that have been published via an open platform called Open Data Aarhus by the City of Aarhus. We examine the framework utilising Symbolic Aggregate Approximation to reduce the size of data streams, and perform quality analysis taking into account both single and multiple data streams. We also investigate the optimisation of the semantic data discovery and integration based on the proposed stream quality analysis and data aggregation techniques.",

While this may be sufficient for some applications, it precludes the possibility of describing and detecting semantic relationships among these events/data and to infer new application-relevant facts out of these relations, which could give an IoT application means of reasoning about the ambient and its context. But since many IoT applications also require timely response times, such semantic reasoning has to happen nearly in real-time, and hence reasoning has to be done over data/event streams, a.k.a Stream Reasoning. This work presents a semantic model and an IoT middleware service for data stream reasoning using a combination of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and continuous queries over streams of RDF semantic data. In our approach we use CEP in the IoT Edge devices to derive time-annotated RDF data from the basic events, and C-SPARQL for processing online queries over a domain ontology, aiming to check if some indirect fact or property about the system or the environment can be deduced. In order to showcase and test the capacity of nearly real-time inference over data streams of our middleware service, we designed and implemented a scenario of fire warning in a hypothetical multi-store building with temperature and humidity sensors.",

Because of the difficulty to schedule in the complex and changeable internal and external environment of the shop floor, an Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled process control method is proposed, using sensors, RFID, industrial wireless communication, automatic identification, and other technologies to perceive the shop floor field. The value of the mean relative error is 1.77, which illustrates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed PN-ACO algorithm to solve flexible job shop scheduling problems. To represent operation sequencing information, a schedule timed transition Petri net (TTPN) is proposed which is evolved from the TTPN. On the basis of the mapping mechanism between the Petri net model and the XML, manufacturing resources become autonomous and interactive distributed intelligent manufacturing resources. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective for scheduling and process control of the IoT-enabled shop floor.",

To accomplish that, we propose a self-organized task distribution framework that is composed of multiple brokers collaborating through our module-based event stream processing engine called EdgeCEP. Our system request is event-dependent specified in a brand-new event specification language; still, the event is stored and processed by the relational database. We newly formulate the problem of self-organized task distribution subjective to preferable constraints of computation and communication. The solution for each broker to find individual optimal decision is to apply tabu search with flow-based greedy move regarding pre-ranking flow table. Many experiments are conducted to study and evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The simulation shows that the proposed flow optimization outperforms the naïve algorithm, concretely, 2-times more tasks getting processed and successfully delivered within the same fixed period. The proposed edge-centric method achieves data traffic 7-times less than the cloud-centric approach. The prototype engines have been deployed and evaluated in the real environment.",

    abstract = "By empowering the IoT with nanoscale communications, thousands of small devices, called nano-nodes, are enabled to monitor complex environments in a nonintrusive way, giving rise to the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) paradigm. It is in one of these very complex and critical environments, the human cardiovascular system, where IoNT might stand out. However, the supervision of human health poses significant challenges: firstly, to reduce costs and allow in vivo monitoring nano-sensor networks, the number of deployed nano-routers must be limited, which could cause nano-nodes to undergo long out-of-coverage periods. Lastly, nano-nodes rely on harvested energy from the medium, which severely reduces the number of potential transmissions. To overcome these two problems, smart policies that direct devices on how to proceed with sensed events are crucial. In this line, we propose a generic Markov Decision Process (MDP) model which can be exploited to derive optimal transmission policies that are easily employed by nano-nodes. These policies maximize nano-node throughput and cope with the energy and coverage problems. We have also run a set of simulations to validate our proposal and to compare it to other alternative policies. Results reveal that: (i) our policy systematically outperforms the rest of policies by a large margin; (ii) precision in placing nano-routers and average distance between them strongly affect the nano-network performance. The Python code for the MDP model and simulations has been programmed to be easily adaptable to researchers’ needs, making it easier for future IoNT works to add intelligence to the network.",

This is possible, by using different devices such as sensors and actuators feeding information that when connected together, enable to monitor and interact with the surrounding environment. Nowadays, there are many devices with different functionalities from multiple manufacturers, which create an interoperability issue of how to interconnect and manage this heterogeneous world of devices. In order to promote interoperability and effectively manage devices it's required to store their data and at the same time handle the registration of each device in a network. The development of a reference architecture can provide a solution for this problem, however a consensus on a reference architecture that can effectively manage this heterogeneous world of devices, is still not yet achieved. Device management is a key feature for any real world solution for a scalable reliable interoperable cloud platform. This gives the capability to add a device, and in that moment enable communication with the rest of the network, sharing information and providing knowledge in an interoperable balanced environment. Adding new devices to a network and assign the necessary services, interfaces and rules will provide a fast track not only in terms of a business-oriented solution but also in back-end management and interoperability. This paper proposes a device management solution based on an architecture and model, to support the registration of devices and propose the necessary services and events, which can be used by a specific device, during its life span inside the physical network.",

This is motivated by the observations that many real-world applications usually have concurrent pattern queries working on the same data streams, leading to tremendous sharing opportunities among queries. In MOTTO, we leverage three major sharing techniques, namely merge, decomposition and operator transformation sharing, to reduce redundant computation among pattern queries. In addition, MOTTO supports nested pattern queries as well as pattern queries with different window sizes.

    abstract  = "With healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the U.S. accounting for an estimated 1.7 million infections and 99,000 deaths annually, reducing and preventing these infections is a top goal for healthcare facilities throughout the country [1]. Not only healthcare facilities, in other captive environments, for instance, ships and cruises, provide environment that may increase risk of infection. According to Minooee and Rickman [2], “Ships provide an isolated environment that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses. High attack rates of influenza, for example, are typically seen in closed settings such as cruises, military vessels, aircraft, and institutions”. The high rates of infection in captive areas are influenced by number of people entering and exiting the place. As per the research summarized by “Hospital infection control: reducing airborne pathogens”[3], the number of people entering and exiting provides a contaminant source. It's known that the concentration of airborne bacteria is proportional to the number of personnel in the room. The amount of surface contamination is also related to airborne contamination from occupation and activity since these microbes settle continuously.” Fencl [3] suggests that the use of disinfection, to control infectious agents in healthcare settings, is one of its oldest and most cost effective ways to control airborne infection. Nichols [1], importantly, suggest that touchless dispensing solutions as an effective way to help reduce the spread of germs. In our view, with advent of machine learning and Internet of Things, combining automated \& intelligent dispensing with touchless systems provides more holistic approach to control infection in healthcare and, more importantly, captive places such as hospitals, cruises, casinos, airports and other places. In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to prevent spread of airborne diseases through the application of Big Data Technologies and IoT Sensing. Our goal is to cutting down the millions of dollars spent on infectious diseases, intelligent dispenser promises to keep hospitals smelling fresh soothing and disinfecting.

The approach is based on a decision making supervisory loop for situation awareness and control combined with a machine learning technique that is especially well suited to this control problem. The goal is to achieve a number of functional requirements: (1) ultra-low false alarm probabilities for all monitored transducers, components, machines, systems, and processes; (2) fastest mathematically possible decisions regarding the incipience or onset of anomalies in noisy process metrics; and (3) the ability to unambiguously differentiate between sensor degradation events and degradation in the systems/processes under surveillance. The novel approach that is presented here does not replace the role of the human in operation of complex engineering systems and processes, but rather augments that role in a manner that minimizes cognitive overload by very rapidly processing, interpreting, and displaying final diagnostic and prognostic information to the human operator in a prioritized format that is readily perceived and comprehended.",

Moreover, the dynamicity due to new services, mobility, etc., could be corrupted by new events that then require the deployment of software components on additional equipment. Those new events arise in at least two fundamental ways: devices that may change their geographical location; and limitations due to hardware resources and energy consumption.

However, local event processing for distributed Internet of Things (IoT) has not been discussed yet. Besides, it is complex or impossible to discover such patterns in some applications of IoT. In this article, we design a complex event service to process event flows based on IoT resource models, which does not depend on existing patterns, and deals with both discrete events and continuous variables. To improve the CEP performance, local IoT resources are used for local event processing, and a lazy exchange method is designed to realize the collaborated event processing between network edges and a data center. Our evaluation shows that our solution is feasible and effective.",

    abstract  = "We always make efforts to predict our future from the past and the present, since the prediction can make great changes in our life, especially in the fields of science and technology. Many organizations in the globe have surveys and announces emerging or disruptive technologies every year. Of course, they have developed their own processes to achieve the goal, but the insights of experts from related domains are usually absolute. In the era of Bigdata, due to the enormous amount of information, domain experts are struggling with timeliness and completeness in developing insights for the future. In KISTI, we introduced a methodology in which human experts are collaborating with machine intelligence to overcome the information flood. Data-intensive analysis methodology is applied to implement the machine intelligence to predict emerging technologies. The intelligent service platform, named InSciTe, includes data gathering, text mining, identity resolution, reasoning, complex event processing, and prescriptive analytics modules. InSciTe generates candidates of emerging technologies with the evidences why they are selected as candidates, and then domain experts make the final decision. In this talk, I will introduce our intelligent service platform based on the data-intensive analysis. Besides, I will show several case studies in the domains of ICT, internet security, and healthcare as joint works with NIPA, KISA, and KRIBB respectively. For the cases with KRIBB, human experts collaborated with machine intelligence interactively to derive the results. We named this approach as Chi(Computer Human Interacting)-Delphi method for technology foresight. As Web goes to connect machine intelligences in the era of Internet of Things, the collaboration between human intelligence and machine intelligence will be eventually the next great wave for predicting the future.",

    abstract  = "The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the emerging paradigm that connects sensors, often located at the edge of the network, to stream processing engines located at the core of the network to enable online data-driven monitoring, management, and control. As IoT applications require increasing volumes of streaming data to be processed by complex workflows in a timely manner, it is becoming important to also leverage resources closer to the edge. Furthermore, the topology of these workflows and where theyare executed is determined not only by application objectives and available resources, but also by the content of the data streams, however, current stream processing engines do not provide this flexibility. In this paper, we present a programming framework that enables applications to specify data-driven, location- and resource-aware processing of data streams. Specifically, it provides abstractions for specifying where and how a data stream is processed based on its content, spatial and temporal characteristics. We also present an implementation of the framework using an event-driven runtime, where events are associatively described. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution by an evaluation of scalability and performance using a disaster response application usecase.",

However, the scale and complexity of personalized service is increasing because of ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of medical sensors, which cause response time increase and resource waste. Therefore, leveraging the advantage of complex event processing (CEP) in data stream processing, we propose a hierarchical fog-cloud computing CEP architecture for personalized service to accelerate response time and reduce resource waste. Firstly, we introduce the proposed architecture, which includes sensor layer, fog layer and cloud layer. Secondly, we propose a series of optimizations for the architecture, there are a partitioning and clustering approach and a communication and parallel processing policy to optimize the fog and cloud computing. Finally, we implement a prototype system based on the architecture named FogCepCare. Experimental result shows that FogCepCare is superior to the traditional IoT-based healthcare application.",

We provide an early evaluation of how our framework can handle a real-world scenario.",

    abstract  = "Big Data Stream processing is among the most important computing trends nowadays. The growing interest on Big Data Stream processing comes from the need of many Internet-based applications that generate huge data streams, whose processing can serve to extract useful analytics and inform for decision making systems. For instance, an IoT-based monitoring systems for a supply-chain, can provide real time data analytics for the business delivery performance. The challenges of processing Big Data Streams reside on coping with real-time processing of an unbounded stream of data, that is, the computing system should be able to compute at high throughput to accommodate the high data stream rate generation in input. Clearly, the higher the data stream rate, the higher should be the throughput to achieve consistency of the processing results (e.g. Preserving the order of events in the data stream). In this paper we show how to map the data stream processing phases (from data generation to final results) to a software chain architecture, which comprises five main components: sensor, extractor, parser, formatter and out putter. We exemplify the approach using the Yahoo!S4 for processing the Big Data Stream from Flight Radar24 global flight monitoring system.",
